# TODO

## Marshal
- Better name for warmable

## Unmarshal
- try catch property assignment (to not have TypeError)
    - same for object construction (like in serializer)
    - then collect errors mode (optional) -> throw at the end with errors and decoded object
    - option and context builder
- bench in CI

## Common
- determine which services are internal
- determine which classes are internal

## Questions
- do we really phpstan? (we might implement it, reduced)
- maybe groups?
- maybe ignore?
- add extra data?
