# TODO

## Unmarshal
- bench in CI

## Common
- re read and uniformize variable names (className/class for example)
- determine which services and classes are internal
- move TemplateCacheWarmer into FrameworkBundle
- create config tree in FrameworkBundle
- create a marshaller.php in FrameworkBundle and remove the MarshallerExtension
- register the compiler pass in the MarshallerExtension
- format for Symfony (tests void for example)

## Questions
- do we really phpstan? (we might implement it, reduced)
- maybe groups?
- maybe ignore?
- add extra data?
- maybe JSON pointer?
