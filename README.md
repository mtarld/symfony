# TODO

- handle mixed
- variable incremented instead of uniqid
- no unset
- union type -> encode get type at runtime (narrowest class)
- move hooks into polyfill
- warmup file
- Better polyfill code (split to handle multiple formats)
- root hook (for why?)


- What to do with depth and generated filename
- Unmarshal (json stream parser with events, object instantiator component)
